## [v3.2.1-1.18.2] - 2023-06-20

### Fixed
- Fixed unintentional breaking api change

## [v3.2.0-1.18.2] - 2023-06-04

## [v3.1.1-1.18.2] - 2023-05-12
Backported v4.2.4 to fix a long-standing issue where Diagonal Fences would duplicate block models for every single block state, whereas vanilla would only use a single model with different selectors applied; leading to extremely high memory usage, making the game easily run out of heap space when paired with other mods that add a lot of fences
